# Spaces In Nova

A Space is a separate gaming setup on your Polaris host, with its own sign-ins,
installed games and saves. Nova connects you to a Space allowed for your paired
device. Preview: one Space at a time, no runtime download yet.

This flow is part of the Spaces preview. Creating, assigning, renaming, removing,
and restoring Spaces happens in the Polaris web interface under **Spaces**.
Polaris also guides the host owner through Docker setup. Nova does not require
Docker on your Android device.

## Open Your Space

1. Pair Nova with your Polaris host if it is not already paired.
2. In Polaris, open **Spaces**. Under **Your Spaces**, open **Default Space** and
   pick the Space for that device.
3. Open the host in Nova. **Your Space** names the selected Space and shows its
   status, beside **Change Space**. In portrait it sits on its own row under the
   library header; in landscape it shares the toolbar with the host name.
4. Choose **Steam Big Picture**, then **Open Steam Big Picture**. Sign into Steam
   and install a game the first time you use this Space.
5. Return to Nova and refresh the library. Select the installed game's poster,
   then **Play**. The library banner follows the focused game.

If a Space cannot start, Nova shows the host's reason with **Try Again** and
**Back to Library**; **View Details** keeps the raw error for a support thread.
If no Space is assigned to the device, the library says so and offers
**Open Spaces in Polaris**. If the host cannot offer Spaces right now, the
library shows the host's reason instead of an empty library.

A Space name identifies the Space; it does not confirm which
Steam account is signed in. Check or switch that account inside Steam Big Picture.
Nova checks access and saved stream settings before launching. Required host
checks, connection errors and settings reviews stay visible before launch.

Nova offers **Resume** only for the matching game and Space session owned by this
device. **In use** means another device is using that Space. Availability remains
subject to the host's current capacity and access rules: the preview runs one
Space at a time, and a Space the host cannot admit says why under **Open Space**.

Older hosts that expose one Space without a game library retain the direct
**Your Space → Open Space** screen. This opens that host's configured launcher;
the current Steam runtime uses Steam Big Picture.

## Choose Another Space

1. In Polaris, under **Your Spaces**, set the device's **Default Space**.
2. On any additional Space card, expand **Device Access** and allow that device.
   Wait for confirmation. Changing access requires all Space streams to be stopped.
3. Open the host in Nova and select **Change Space**. Only your permitted Spaces appear.
4. Pick a Space to browse its games. Each row shows the Space's status: **Ready**,
   **Starting**, **Playing**, **In use**, **Stopping** or **Unavailable**. You can
   pick a Space that is starting, stopping or in use to browse it; opening it
   waits until it reads **Ready**. The current Space is marked, and **Desktop** is
   a row like the others when the device may stream the host's desktop.

Choosing a Space does not launch it. Polaris remembers your choice for this device
across app and host restarts. Your device must finish its current stream and cleanup
before switching. Other devices can keep playing while you choose.

**In use** means another device is using that Space. Choose another or wait for it
to become ready. Nova checks status while this screen is open and checks again
before opening. **Starting** and **Stopping** keep **Open Space** unavailable until
the host finishes. If the status cannot be checked, the row reads **Status unknown**
and Nova keeps trying; choosing still works, and the host confirms the choice.
Older hosts without the chooser API retain their existing single-Space flow.

## Change Stream Settings

Select a game, then open **Play Setup**. The host's available choices include
**Resolution** and **Frame Rate**. **Change Space** lists your permitted Spaces:
a Space where the game is not installed offers that Space's Steam instead, and
a Space that is starting, stopping or in use says so. These stream preferences are
saved on this Android device and applied on the next Space launch. Settings
currently follow the device's assigned Space; they are not separate saved presets
for each Steam account.

Select **Frame Rate**, then the desired rate when offered. Nova offers up to
**240 FPS** on supported displays; a 120 Hz handheld offers rates through
**120 FPS**. The host must also accept the requested stream. A selected rate is a
target, and does not establish sustained game rendering or actual presentation.
Check gameplay, audio and frame pacing with all intended Spaces running.

If Polaris offers a different resolution or frame rate from your explicit choice,
Nova shows the host settings and waits before opening the Space. Choose **Auto**
for **Frame Rate** and **Device Settings** for **Resolution** to follow the host,
or update the device’s display settings in Polaris and retry.

Return to the library without launching when you have finished adjusting settings.
On the older direct Space screen, use **Stream Settings**, then **Done**.
Codec, bitrate, and other device-wide preferences remain available through
**System**, then Nova's streaming settings.

Spaces currently use the host runtime's fixed codec and quality contract. Nova's
general Streaming Presets remain separate from Space selection.

## Use A Controller

Use the D-pad to move through game posters and the toolbar, **A** to select, and
**B** to return. The artwork and selected-game banner follow focus. In landscape
the toolbar keeps the host name, your Space and the library controls in one row;
on narrow screens or with enlarged text, controller focus scrolls it to keep each
action reachable. In portrait your Space has its own row under the header. Touch
controls perform the same actions.

On the older single-Space screen, **X** opens Stream Settings. Returning from
settings restores the previous action.

## Ordinary Streaming And Shared Hosts

Hosts serving ordinary games retain the existing Library. Nova does not add a
required Spaces tab or a setup step for ordinary streaming. With one allowed Space,
its library opens directly. With several, **Change Space** stays in the toolbar.

**Remove Space** in Polaris retains its Steam data and installed games. It removes
device access and does not reclaim disk space. Restore it and assign the device
again before returning to Nova. Restorable Spaces are listed under **Archived Spaces**.

## Check Sound And Stuttering

For a comparison, ask the host owner to offer 1080p at 60 FPS for your device.
In **Play Setup** (or **Stream Settings** on an older host), choose **Auto** for **Frame Rate** and **Device Settings**
for **Resolution**. Begin with one Space, then check again with the other
players connected.

If audio crackles or pauses, note the time, game, Space, stream settings, and
whether the client uses Wi-Fi or Ethernet. Note whether picture or controls
paused too. Low average latency and zero reported video packet loss do not rule
out brief audio delivery pauses.

Save before reconnecting: the current runtime ends its game session when the
stream disconnects. **Leave Space** explains this before you confirm. It keeps
the Space's installed games, saved data and Steam sign-in. A dropped connection
can also end the session; Resume does not promise to recover a disconnected game.

When possible, repeat with the same client over Ethernet or another access
point, keeping the game and stream settings unchanged. Ask the host owner to
compare with downloads, builds, and updates paused. Change one thing at a time.
The [Polaris troubleshooting steps](https://github.com/papi-ux/polaris/blob/master/docs/spaces.md#check-sound-and-stuttering)
explain what to retain for Doctor & Support. Audio reliability is still being
validated for the preview.

## Preview Status

The preview's validation record and its limits live in the
[September 15 acceptance report](https://github.com/papi-ux/polaris/blob/master/docs/research/container-multiseat-acceptance-20260915.md).
It does not establish sustained 120 or 240 FPS gameplay, a complete first
installation from published artifacts, or reliable audio on every client.
